# requirements-dev.txt
# ===================
# This file lists development dependencies for the project.
# These packages are needed only for development, testing, and CI workflows,
# and are NOT required for the runtime of the main application.
#
# To install these dependencies, run:
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# -------------------
# Testing Frameworks

# pytest-cov: generates coverage reports for your tests.
# pytest-cov>=5.0.0

# -------------------

# -------------------
# Notes:
# -------------------
# - Keep this file separate from requirements.txt to clearly distinguish 
#   runtime dependencies from development/testing dependencies.
# - It is recommended to install this in a virtual environment to avoid polluting 
#   the system Python installation.
